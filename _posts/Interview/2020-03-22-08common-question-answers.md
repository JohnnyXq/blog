## Tell me about yourself.
1. I graduated from xyz University with a Bachelor's degree in computer science
and technology in 20xx
2. I started off my career as the software engineer with xyz company
3. I was in charge of developing web application as well as design the page
4. I also assisted with developing the components of the pages.
5. I was in that position for 2 years. Then I had the opportunity to be Front end developer for xyz company
6. Then I was promoted to the lead of this team. I was also responsible for review the code written by my colleague
7. My duties also include train new people who come to our company
8. I think solving these problems is so much fun and in my spare time, I really like writing code to improve myself.
职责，工作内容一起说出来，省的别人问的时候自己听不懂，直接说出来更礼貌，也节省时间

## What are your strengths?
1. I have some core strengths that, I feel, make me the ideal candidate for this position. I am a strong team worker, excellent at customer service, and also someone who can plan and prioritize tasks to ensure I help my employer move forward positively. I am also someone who embraces change positively, I am flexible in my role and available to work additional hours when needed and also someone who continually look to improve and develop
2. My strongest trait is attention to detail, I totally believe in planning and execution, In fact even when I was in college, I used to organize my week and many people

## What are your weakness?
I think my weakness is that I am way to detail oriented. I try to accomplish everything and I just want everything to be perfect, but then I realize that I'm losing out on time, so maybe that makes me submitting these projects a little late. So I think that is one of the weaknesses, but what's good for me, everything is changing better.

## Where do you see yourself in five years?
What are your long term/short term goals? five years from now, I think I would like to be in a management position or a senior engineer. Till then, I would like to gain a practical experience and then eventually become a manager. Of course I would like to share and also learn a lot of new things from my team members.

## What do you know about my company?
Your company is well-known for the customer service and you also won an award for the best service provider in the country. And of course, you also have a great clientele.

## How well do you handle change?
Of course I can handle a change, because in my previous company, one of my immediate leader had a quit and there was a new leader, who came in and he had completely changed our strategy of that project. So of course, I'm very flexible and hardworking too, we managed it with our team efforts and definitely the results were pretty good.

## Do you work well under pressure?
Working under pressure or without pressure works just the same for me. In fact in one of the companies that I was working, there was a project that was given to us, which had to be completed in four days. Which usually takes ten days and the whole team is like so stressed out, they panicked and they just didn't know what to do, but then I insured that they settled down. We prioritized our work and in a very organized manner, we completed the project. Of course we also worked late nights but that definitely helped to submit our project in four days. So I think working under pressure is not too bad for me.

## How do you make important decisions?
Handling decisions is definitely considered to be a little difficult, but I am sure I can do it, because my experience I would rely on my experience, I would also weigh on the pros and cons. Of course, I would take some advice from my team members and I'm sure that would help me to come on a decision. We will also look at the consequences of the decision. So definitely I can go ahead and make decisions.
